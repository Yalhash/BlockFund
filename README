After the second version of the campaign I had wanted to enter into the web interface, but I changed my mind since learning more about how to work with on chain concepts has been more interesting to me.

  This time, it was a simple update to introduce a token-based campaign. For now, it involves only a single token, but I believe the next steps will involve a multi-token campaign that can compare prices using something like the Uniswap TWAP oracle.

Working with ERC20 tokens, I was hoping to find a way for users to donate in a single transaction, but this appears to be impossible due to how those contracts are set up, which makes sense for security reasons. There is a way to do this, I could enhance the interface to allow for the permit based transactions which use off-chain signing of a transaction to allow for transfers to take place in one transaction.

In implementing this version, I had to learn how to properly use a testnet, and interact with real token contracts.

Next steps are to expand the token campaign interface and add a mixed ETH/token contract, which will need to compare prices of the contracts in order to settle the capaign.
